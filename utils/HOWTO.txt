This document how to run the Microgrids (aka "MGT") simulation code on an Altair PBS cluster.

1. Introduction
	For each server, there are two "main" scripts that should be run by the user:
	- <server name>_loop_1p.sh - for "1 processor", i.e. no parpool.
	- <server name>_loop_mp.sh - for "multiple processors", i.e. with parpool.

	Each of the above scripts has a "secondary" script which it calls, with the name "run_sim_<server initial>_<#>p.sh". 
	The secondary scripts actually queue the execution of the respective MATLAB functions (runAlgorithms_1p.m, runAlgorithms.m).
	Several versions of the MATLAB functions can be found in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/TurboHeat/microgrids
		(as of the time of writing, on the `develop` branch).

2. Execution
	The main scripts *should* be edited as necessary before each run, to ensure only the relevant cases are being computed.
	It is up to the user to set the correct # of CPUs (at the top of the main file), otherwise the cluster might terminate the job prematurely.
	In the case of Zeus, the submission queue can also be set in the main script.

	The secondary scripts *may need to* be edited to change some hard-coded configurations (e.g., MATLAB function signatures), but SHOULD NOT BE INVOKED DIRECTLY.

	Below are the commands to execute in the terminal to start the simulations for the server "zeus":

		bash zeus_loop_1p.sh
		bash zeus_loop_mp.sh
		
	When submitting a job to Zeus, it might be necessary to change the queue. For Technion users there are two relevant options:
	"zeus_all_q" and "zeus_long_q", for 24h and 72h computation windows, respectively.

	For more information see:

3. Monitoring
	After submitting the jobs, here are several locations to monitor:
	1)	The working directory (where this file is found), for files looking like "<Job Name>.[eo]<Job ID>" (where .e is stderr, and .o is stdout). 
		If these files exist, it indicates that the job finished or stopped. 
		A successful job typically has an .o file of size 84 and an .e file of size 0.
	2)	The "cluster_jobs" folder at /home/<username>/.matlab/local_cluster_jobs/R202##. 
		Here it's important to see that a new Job folder + 4 files are created, about 20sec after submitting a job.
	3)	The /logs folder, for timestamped outputs of the MATLAB scripts.
